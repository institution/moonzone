random init - only some subset is of weigths combination usefull
if all weigth > 0 net will probably wont learn

cross 0-problem - IT IS DIFFICULT FOR WEIGTH TO CROSS ZERO BOUNDARY (todo: verify)
net needs +/- weigths in right positions to learn
+1/-1 random init should work if not weight collapse problem
weight collapse - weigths have equal value and equal gradient
zero collapse - some weigths are stuct at zero

cross 0-problem possible solutions:
	each weight have +/- components: w = w+ + w-

zero collapse
	w+ and w- cannot be zero?

weight collapse possible solutions:
	each weight have random learning speed parameter





does is depend on problem or nn architecture?
