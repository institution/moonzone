--------------------------- Design

general constraints
	terrain simulation vres:  x 100
	window and fullscreen mode
	ability to resize window
	one terrain map
	some kind of terrain modification on explosions
	single color, distance field rendering of everything
	tight architecture

design
	coordinate screen:   0-0 in left-bottom, x-y goes right-up
	coordinate textures: 0-0 in left-top   , x-y goes right-down
	virtual screen resolution: 160x100, xres depends on aspect ratio, yres is const
	c with minimal abstractions (tight architecture)
	minimal scons build system
	OpenGL 3.0 ES
	graphic pipeline: png+rc->ss
	gui: terrain+bottom bar controls

controls
	thrust: mouse up/down   , arrow up/down   , W/S
	angle:  mouse left/right, arrow left/right, A/D

	turn: space
	engine: e
	eject: j
	gear: g
	fullscreen: F11, f
	screenshoot: F12, g
	hide controls:   F10
	weapon 1: 1
	weapon 2: 2
	weapon 3: 3

--------------------------- Progress/TODO

display helo: engines+helo+thrust
steer helo with keyboard

display terrain
scroll terrain when helo moves

add gravity
detect collision with terrain

ability to exit helo
display walkable chap

fire missle form helo
missle scan cone detecting heat signatures
missle physics, AI
